# TuringTex

This is a little project of mine: TuringTeX - the simulation of a deterministic Turing machine within TeX.
The next-state rules can be given in the usual mathematical notation as 5-tuples, TeX will do the rest, i.e. calculating the new states and exporting the results as an ordinary document.
This makes it possible to try out a given Turing machine easily (if there is the need to do so); simply define the rules in a LaTeX source file and compile it.
